- This code snippet sets up an audio player with basic controls such as play, pause, stop, volume control, and track navigation.
-
- The code imports a music list from a separate module and creates an AudioContext. It then connects the audio element to the audio context and creates a gain node for volume control.
-
- The play button event listener plays or pauses the audio based on its current state. If the audio is paused, it resumes playback from the current time. If the audio is playing, it pauses playback.
-
- The sampleAudio element has event listeners for "ended" to automatically play the next track when the current track ends, "loadedmetadata" to set the maximum value of the audio tracker, and "timeupdate" to update the value of the audio tracker as the audio plays.
-
- The audio tracker element has an event listener for "input" to update the current time of the audio when the user interacts with the tracker.
-
- The stop button event listener pauses the audio and resets the current time to 0.
-
- The volume controller element has an event listener for "input" to update the volume of the audio using the gain node.
-
- The previous and next buttons event listeners navigate to the previous or next track in the music list, respectively, using circular indexing to loop back to the beginning or end of the list.
